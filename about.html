    <p>I consider myself a mathematician, in the etimological sense of the word (see the <a href="maths.html">maths</a> section).</p>

    <p>I have been studying pure mathematics for many years, and since January 2015 I have been working in the R&D team in <a href="maths.html">Path Intelligence</a>. In this year, I have quickly learnt Python and I have become a fundamental assett in my team, working on the key algorithm of the company that translates WiFi-raw data into location analytics.</p>

    <p>I do enjoy facing complex problems and find a variety of creative and "out of the box" solutions - the plural is meant because having more solutions to choose from will increase the possibility of best exploiting the tools that are in use.</p>

    <p>If you feel curious, you can view my <a href="http://raffo85h.github.io/life/">timeline</a> of important events in my life, created by using the project <i>life</i> by <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/life">cheeta.</a></p>
