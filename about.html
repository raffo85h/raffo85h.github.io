    <p>I consider myself a mathematician, in the etimological sense of the word (see the <a href="maths.html">maths</a> section).</p>

    <p>I studied pure mathematics for many years. Since January 2016 I have been working in the R&D team in <a href="cv.html">Flight Data Services</a> as Data Scientist, analysing and developing machine learning for Flight Data. Previously, I was an RF/DSP Developer for Path Intelligence, a location analytics company.</p>

    <p>I do enjoy facing complex problems and find a variety of creative and "out of the box" solutions. I am passionate in writing clean and full tested code in order to automate data extraction/mining/analysis and visualisation. I constantly search and study the newest cutting-edge technology in machine learning.</p>

    <p>If you feel curious, you can view my <a href="http://raffo85h.github.io/life/">timeline</a> of important events in my life, created by using the project <i>life</i> by <a href="https://github.com/cheeaun/life">cheeta.</a></p>
